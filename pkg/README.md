  Hookuspokus - add hooks to all the functions!
</p>

This is a small JavaScript library that will allow you to add hooks ([see react docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)) to any function.

It provides the basic hooks from which you can build more complex hooks:

- useReducer
- useState
- useEffect
