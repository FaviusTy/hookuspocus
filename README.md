  Hookuspokus - add hooks to all the functions!
</p>

# hookuspocus

This is a small JavaScript library that will allow you to add hooks ([see react docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)) to any function.

It provides all the basic hooks from which you can build more complex hooks:
- useReducer
- useState
- useEffect

A proper documentation will be added later. If you want to see this library in action, look at [funcy.js](https://github.com/michael-klein/funcy.js), were it's used to implement all of the hooks.
